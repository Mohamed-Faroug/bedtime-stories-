 ChatGPT prompt you can use in the future to create bedtime stories in a similar style, focusing on Sudanese folklore and storytelling elements:
Prompt:
"I want you to create a Sudanese bedtime story in the style of traditional storytelling as told by grandmothers (حبوبات) but with a modern, engaging twist for children. The story should:

Be written in Sudanese Arabic dialect (دارجي سوداني).
Include vivid descriptions of characters, settings, and emotions to capture a child’s imagination.
Incorporate a strong moral or lesson (e.g., bravery, kindness, or cleverness).
Feature traditional Sudanese elements, such as village life, animals, or folklore characters like الغول or الحكامة.
Use repetition and rhythm in dialogue or narration to make it soothing for bedtime.
Start with a classic opening like: "في يوم من الأيام، في قرية صغيرة..." and end with a calming conclusion like: "ومن يومها، عاشوا في سبات ونبات وخلفه صبيان وبنات."
Keep the tone warm, imaginative, and suitable for children."
